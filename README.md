_How does a gopher oversee and administrate a terraforming project?_

Welcome to my kitchen-sink CLI tool for working with terraform configurations.

So far the main branch has a skeleton of a CLI application, but more features
will be coming soon!

This project follows the [Standard Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
